Creating decision tree to help doctors choosing medication for patients

Choosing the right medication for a patient can be a complex process. Factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and sodium-to-potassium ratios are some example of factors which determine the decision for a treatment. 
With so many data to consider, decision-making using machine learning tools such as decision trees may come in handy.

In this project, I am exploring how decision trees can help doctors of pharmacists predict the most suitable drug for a patient. 
The dataset I’m working will include patient’s information : age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and sodium-to-potassium ratio.

Based on those information, the decision tree model will determine the appropriate medication from five options : Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X, or Drug Y. 
This project will also provide a visual breakdown of the decision-making process, to make it easier to interpret the reason of a specific drug is recommended for a particular patient.
