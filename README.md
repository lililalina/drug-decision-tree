Drug Decision Tree

Using Decision Trees to Support Medication Selection

Choosing the right medication for a patient can be a complex process. Factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio play a crucial role in determining the appropriate treatment. With so many variables to consider, machine learning tools like decision trees can support more informed, data-driven decisions.

In this project, I explore how decision tree models can assist doctors and pharmacists in predicting the most suitable drug for a patient based on clinical characteristics.
